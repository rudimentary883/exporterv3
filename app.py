"""
Tabbycat Break Exporter v3.7
  * v3.7: + /barcodes page: Code 128 check-in barcodes (340 x 50 px, the same as the tab site's JsBarcode ones) from a list of
          names + six-digit identifiers -> XLSX with the barcode picture INSIDE each cell (for Canva Bulk create) or a ZIP of PNGs
Tabbycat Break Exporter v3.6
  * v3.6: + optional text after the speaker RANK in the awarding export (suffix_rank: "2ND" -> "2ND BEST EFL SPEAKER")
          + ordinal_case: "upper" (1ST, 2ND, 3RD, 41ST) or "lower" (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 41st) for the break rank and the speaker rank
Tabbycat Break Exporter v3.5
  * v3.5: break export keeps the order of Tabbycat's admin break table (the standings RANK), also for teams that are not
          breaking. Their remark (Capped / Ineligible / Reserve / Withdrawn ...) goes into the "break" column and the
          separate remark column is gone (break AND awards exports).
          + optional text next to the values (for Canva bulk create): suffix_break, suffix_points, suffix_score,
            suffix_average  ->  "1ST OPEN BREAKING TEAM", "19 Team Points", "1125 Speaker Points", "81.50 average speaks"
          - speakers are no longer flagged as anonymous in the awards export
Tabbycat Break Exporter v3.4
  * v3.4: + AWARDING export ("export_type": "awards"): the top speakers of the open speaker tab, of any speaker category
          (e.g. unioncup) and - for 3v3 / WSDC - of the reply speaker tab. Columns: rank, speaker, team, average
          (+ the same "intro" rows as the break export: rank + average only, speaker and team blank).
          Ties: everybody with rank <= 10 is included (a 4-way tie for 8th gives 12 speakers, the 12th-ranked is left out).
Tabbycat Break Exporter v3.3
  * v3.3: one profile per debate format (see FORMAT_CONFIG)
          BP    : points, total speaker score, 1sts, 2nds, draw strength by wins       (speakers joined by " & ")
          3v3   : wins, total speaker score                                            (speakers joined by ", ")  AP / Australs / UADC
          WSDC  : wins, average total speaker score (ATSS)                             (speakers joined by ", ")  3-5 speakers
          + the "break" column now follows Tabbycat's Break column (break_rank), never the standings Rank
          + teams that did not break (withdrawn / reserve / capped ...) are still exported, with their remark
Tabbycat Break Exporter v3.2
  * v3.1: code_name column + ALL CAPS ordinals
  * v3.2: + number_of_1sts, number_of_2nds, draw_strength_by_wins (after total_speaker_score)
          + "intro" rows: every ranked breaking team gets a first row with ONLY
            break / points / total_speaker_score / number_of_1sts / number_of_2nds / draw_strength_by_wins,
            followed by its full row (so Google Slides can show an intro slide, then the reveal slide)
          + sturdier API reading (see the notes next to each change)

READ-ONLY: this app only sends GET requests to Tabbycat. It works with an ADMIN token, so the
breaking teams can be exported BEFORE the break is released to the public.
